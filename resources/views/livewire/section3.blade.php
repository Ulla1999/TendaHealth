        <h1>Focus on the individual</h1>
        <p>At Tendahealth we consider individual clients as important as our corporate clients. During office hours
            we offer a voice-logged service through our call centre with experienced consultants who will be able to
            assist in both English and Afrikaans with an independent analysis of each scheme and insurers’ ability
            to meet the client’s specific needs. A dedicated consultant annually assists clients to reassess their
            portfolio, present new or suggest alternative products based on changing needs.</p>
