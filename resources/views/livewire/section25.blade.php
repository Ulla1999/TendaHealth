            <h1>Why choose Sanlam Gap?</h1>
            <span>From R219 for individuals, and R385 for families, Sanlam Gap Cover insurance provides for the
                difference between what your medical aid pays and the rates charged by medical specialists. In certain
                cases the cost for in-hospital procedures or outpatient treatment may exceed the base medical aid rate
                by an additional 5-times. By taking out Sanlam Medical Gap Cover Insurance, you ensure that you and your
                family arenâ€™t left with a large excess amount to settle.</span>
