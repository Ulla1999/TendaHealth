        <h1>GAP cover and other value add products</h1>
        <h2>Gap cover augments medical schemes’ offering through providing additional cover for in-hospital expenses not
            covered by a medical scheme.
            <h2>
                <p>Many healthcare professionals charge considerably more than the cover provided by medical schemes.
                    This creates a gap between what the medical scheme pays and the costs incurred – without gap cover
                    the member of a medical scheme will be liable for the difference in cost. Taking into consideration
                    that services rendered in hospital are predominantly provided by specialists and surgeons it could
                    be a sizeable amount. Tendahealth offers its clients several gap cover solutions. Gap cover provides
                    cover for in-hospital shortfalls involving surgery and medical treatment as well as for certain
                    procedures performed out-of-hospital. Gap cover is only available to members of a medical scheme.
