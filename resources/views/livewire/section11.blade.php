                    <p>The medical schemes industry is complex and highly regulated. Medical schemes are compelled to
                        provide certain benefits and use networks, co-payments, pre-authorisations, exclusions and
                        limits in
                        an effort to manage the rising cost of healthcare services and still offer cover at an
                        affordable
                        rate. Consumers may easily fall victim to industry-specific jargon, product structures that are
                        difficult to understand and benefits with hidden costs which could result in high direct
                        expenses.
